If one of these doesn't work... You're doing something wrong

header( "LOCATION: http://example.com/" );  // Note that this will not change url / state

<head><meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2;url=http://example.com" /></head>

<script type="text/javascript"> window.location = "http://www.example.com/" </script>
